/*
Reverse String in Place
Write a function to reverse a string in-place.

Since strings in JavaScript are immutable â†´ , first convert the string into
an array of characters, do the in-place reversal on that array, and re-join
that array into a string before returning it. This isn't technically "in-place"
and the array of characters will cost O(n)O(n) additional space, but it's a
reasonable way to stay within the spirit of the challenge. If you're comfortable
coding in a language with mutable strings, that'd be even better!
