# JS Challenges

These are my solutions to some coding challenges.

## Approach

I'll solve interesting coding challenges following a test-driven approach.
These solutions may not be the most efficient or beautiful but I'm learning by doing. üë©‚Äçüíª

## Run the tests

To execute the algorithms and run the tests in the console you will need to have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. You can check how I did it using [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) in one of my blog post, where I wrote about [setting up my development environment.](https://groundberry.github.io/setup/2016/08/29/setting-up-my-development-environment.html)

Then, you can clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/groundberry/js-challenges.git
```

Make it the current directory:

```
$ cd js-challenges
```

And run the tests with npm:

```
$ npm test
```
